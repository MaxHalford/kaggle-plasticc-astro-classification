# Kaggle PLAsTiCC 22nd place

This was my solution to the [PLAsTiCC Astronomical Classification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018/) on Kaggle. I ended at 22nd place with my team, called "WTFlux". Our ranking was quite high, but the score we got (0.86805) was from the best (0.68503) and so I didn't bother to nicely package my solution. The code should be quite clear, though. On a personal level the competition was interesting because I created a tool to extract aggregate features from large datasets, called [tuna](https://github.com/MaxHalford/tuna/).
